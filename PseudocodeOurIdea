# Pseudocode
# Introductory statements

# Initiate Alexa
# Ask for Mock Interview

# Alexa states categories, User responds with a category name.

# Alexa asks for the number of questions, user responds.

# Randomly select those numbers of questions.

# Loop: Ask question. Wait until user says next question or skip. In which case alexa reads next quesiton until
# reach end of number of questions or user says stop. 

# More to this Idea
# Email file which Alexa parses for other interview quesitons which alexa can ask you after entering
# them into her database as a separate table. Which she can ask questions from that database of questions.
